Hello there! I'm a second-year medical physics PhD student at the University of British Columbia. I'm advised by [Samantha Lloyd](http://www.vanradmed.com/dr.-samantha-lloyd) and [Stefan Reinsberg](https://pfeifer.phas.ubc.ca/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:user:stefan), and am affiliated with [BC Cancer](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/) and the [VanRadMed](http://www.vanradmed.com/) group.

My main research interests are in the application of radiomics and artificial intelligence in radiation oncology. 

Previously, I majored in Biophysics at the University of British Columbia and completed an Honours thesis under the guidance of [Cornelia Laule](http://www.mripathology.ca/) and [Roger Tam](https://blogs.ubc.ca/rogertam/). Before that, I did research at the [International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries](https://icord.org/) with [Brian Kwon](https://icord.org/researchers/dr-brian-kwon/) and [Babak Shadgan](https://biosensing.med.ubc.ca/ibl-team/babak-shadgan/). I've also spent time at the [Genome Institute of Singapore](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis) with [Niranjan Nagarajan](https://csb5.github.io/index.html). My first research experience was in entomology with [Gerhard Gries](https://www.sfu.ca/gries-lab.html) at Simon Fraser University.

In my spare time, I like to powerlift and grow mushrooms.
